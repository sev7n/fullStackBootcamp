    * Great UI and easy to use.
    
    * Lots of online resources and 
    community to help with problems.

* Cons

  * Very limited for those wanting to learn advanced HTML/CSS (HTML5).
  
  * Sometimes buggy.

* Who is it good for?

  * Lacking advanced content for HTML/CSS. Can learn basics, though. 

* Who is it good for?
  
  * Those learning basics of HTML and CSS.
